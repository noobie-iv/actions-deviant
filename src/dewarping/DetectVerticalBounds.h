/**
 * @brief Takes a list of traced curves and fits two lines to their endpoints.
 *
 * The sampling direction within a curve has to be consistent among all curves.
 * That is, the head of each polyline should correspond to the same side of the page.
 *
 * @param curves The list of curves to process.
 * @param dist_threshold The maximum distance between a vertical bound and a
 *        curve endpoint where the vertical bound is considered supported by
 *        the endpoint.
 * @return A pair of lines representing the vertical bounds. The first line
 *         in a pair corresponds to head endpoints of curves. In case of a
 *         failure, one or both of the returned lines will be null.
